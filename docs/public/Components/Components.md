#Components

Components are objects that have properties that depend on the purpose of the component. These properties are accessed by [Systems](../Systems/Systems.md) to do game logic.

[Assemblages](Assemblages.md) are groups of components.

Current components are:

[Transform](ComponentTransform.md)

[Physics](ComponentPhysics.md)

[Unit](ComponentUnit.md)

[UserOwned](ComponentUserOwned.md)
